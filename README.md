Hello, and welcome to the repository for the Velt documentation!

The `generator` folder is for all of our latest scripts and typings. This is for https://velt.js.org/docs, feel free to get the current Velt typings, use `typedoc` to generate new docs, and then add them into their respective folders in the `docs` folder!

This uses `mkdocs` to generate the general docs too. That's all, thanks!
